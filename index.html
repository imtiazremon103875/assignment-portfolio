                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>No doubt I had a wonderful year and it is coming to an end. I still canâ€™t believe how fast 2021 got
                    over and it's just a few days left for 2022. As a normal programmer, I do have a plan for making my
                    2022 more productive and successful for me.everyone pray for me..for my success.</p>

                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>Being a programmer is easy but surviving and upgrading as a programmer is a huge task for many. I am
                    sure
                    many readers are ready to start their 2022 with positivity and try their best to achieve the success
                    which they already wished for.</p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>I am so happy that I finalized my goals which I will try my best to accomplish in 2022 and have a
                    successful year. Most importantly I will keep a track of my mental health and energy levels in the
                    first 3 months of a new year which will help me to do some changes accordingly.</p>
